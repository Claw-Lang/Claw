|Modulo Assignment| `%=`|Assignment of value modulo current value assigned|
|Power Assignment| `^=`|Assignment of assigned value to the power of value|


## Operator Overloading

Operators can be user-defined by defining functions using the keyword `operator` followed by the specified operator, and with one (for unary operators) or two (for binary operators)

```py
def operator + (x: int, y:int) -> int
	return 42

def operator - (x: int) -> int
	return 0

print(3+5)  # Prints 42
print(-20)  # Prints 0
```
